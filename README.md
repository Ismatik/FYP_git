Inventory Management System Based on QR code Scanning. 

Abstract: 

Keeping track of the things, making sure
everything is enough, not broken or lost is done
manually, by people coming and checking every
supply by themselves. It takes lots of time and
effort, a big amount of paperwork. My goal is to
make the process faster, more effective, and
efficient. IMS (Inventory Management System)
is a set of tools and software, where a person
or an organization can track, maintain, and
record all of the supplies throughout the entire
supply chain. Automatization and digitalization
of manual processes save a lot of human energy
and time, making results more precise and with
fewer errors. But the secret of great products is
that they not only cover the needs of people and
help them to solve problems: great products as
well are pleasing. All of the existing solutions
of the Inventory Management System market,
while being unique depending on the segment
of customers theyâ€™re focused on, and the sphere
where the system will be applied (medical, tech,
construction) have something in common - the
lack of great design, intuitive design. Easy in
usage product is a successfully made product -
user should not face any difficulty and hitch.
